<h1>User Profile</h1>

* <b>Monthly Start Off Balance</b> - the user can edit this when they "click" the edit balance button.
* <b>Current Balance</b> - this is calculated by subtracting the "Total Spent This Month" amount from the "Monthly Start off Balance".
* <b>Monthly Budget</b> - in the categories section the user can assign a budget to a category e.g.("Food", Â£210). The monthly budget is calculated by taking the sum of the budgets that have been assigned to each category.
* <b>Total Spent This Month</b> - this is calculated by taking the sum of all the transactions that have occurred over the current month.

<h1>The Project Brief</h1>

<h2>General Brief</h2>

* 7 days to plan, design and create an app.
* Restricted to only using python, HMTL and CSS - no JavaScript :( 

<h2>Specific Brief</h2>
<h3>Spending Tracker</h3>

Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

<b>MVP</b>
* The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail.
* The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport.
* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.
Inspired by:
Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps

<b>Extensions</b>

* Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the date they took place.
* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
